* remove tdl, as it's deprecated, and switch to pure libtcod:
  https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod

* move all CONSTANTS to a separate file

* improve use of colors (roguecolors was good following the tutorial, but now, move to something simpler)
    * themes ? greyscale, high contrast for color impaired, dark, light ?

* generalize place_objects()
    * items and monsters definition should be in a separate 'configuration' file
